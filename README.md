# Cluster Resource Forecast

*This is not an officially supported Google product.*

This repository contains experimental tools we developed to forecast a clusters'
resource (CPU or memory) usage.

We are using [googlecluster-data](https://github.com/google/cluster-data) to
evaluate the forecast accuracy and efficiency.

This is an experimental project. None of the work in this repository has been
used inside Google.
